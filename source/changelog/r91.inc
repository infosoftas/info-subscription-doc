API and Backend
===============
The following new features and improvements are now available in the API and the backend.

* Expanded the summary result information when importing Mastercard Paymentservices OCR files.
* Adjustments to the BgMax file to handle payments from Autogiro.
* Added API validation to prevent empty standalone account demands from being generated by billing.
* Fixed an issue where reminder fees would not propagate correctly to the Invoice Document.
* Fixed an issue where the reporting subsystem would not update payment agreements on subscriptions when automatically changed.
* PayEx POPS related payments are now blocked entirely before being sent to PayEx (where they would sometime actually succeed even though the platform is reported shut down).
* Fixed an issue where an attempt was made to automatically adjust payment agreements on cancelled subscriptions.
* Fixed an issue with reminder fees not being accumulated on multiple reminders.
* Fixed an issue with scheduling for Avtalegiro on the first subscription period would end up issuing demands with an adjusted due date but still keep Invoice as the provider type. Now it correctly keeps the original due date.
