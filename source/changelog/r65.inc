Release November 6th 2019
**************************
The following changes were rolled out to production on November 6th 2019

API and Backend
===============
The following new features and improvements are now available in the API and the backend

* Streamlined and expanded filtering options on Invoice, Reminder and CreditNote
    * This has introduced a breaking change in the API on how to get Credit Notes and Reminders, please refer to the swagger spec for details.
    * Added new fields MinimumIssuedOnDate and MaximumIssuedOnDate to replace Start and End fields, mostly to make it more clear what the filter does. The old fields will be removed in a later release.
* Added CancellationTime and CancellationReason to the Subscription details. This allows for clients to prevent access on cancelled subscriptions before they originally expired.
* Norwegian addressess will now be automatically matched using Kartverket when generating Recurring Deliveries
* Added handling of subscriptions without a default Subscriber Account (previously various changes such as pausing and crediting would lead to strange result due to missing account).
* Changed EHF generation to conform more strictly to spec (and thus removing warnings generated by the validator).
* Extended payment demands reporting with a source to track production demands separately from imported demands.
* Fixed an error that prevented ending recurring deliveries.
* Fixed issue that prevented capture of funds with PayEx (hotfix previously deployed to production).
* Fixed an issue in reporting where subscription details were not updated correctly.
* Reminders now include a reference to the original Invoice.
* Added Product Grouping configuration support for reporting
* Fixed issue that caused Payment Stop rules to not be evaluated for orders.
* Added support for populating Invoice Recipient Identifications from the contact when using a contact as Invoice Payer.
* Fixed issue where adding a payment on an Enterprise Plan would not settle the demand.


Client
======
The following new features and improvements are now available in the web client

* Added support for providing a static Invoice Reference (name/number) on a Subscriber Contact (Preview Feature, Not supported throughout the backend completely)
* New view for managing unmatched payments (Preview feature)
* Adjustments to Enterprise Plan views.
* Added new filtering/lookup views, to directly find items such as Invoices or Credit Notes (Preview feature)
* Several plan configuration options and credit feature is now generally available for everyone.
* General Subscriber overview improvements
* Fixed issue that caused payment and creditnote reports to malfunction when using a locale aware browser with a different date format than the ISO 8601 Format.
* Issue where manually registering payments on an invoice would not pre-populate fields correctly.

Known Issues
============

* When demands and invoices with reminders (that has fees) are paid, it is not obvious from the API and the client whether the fee on the demand has been settled or not.
* External Invoice Identifiers may be generated in a way that exceeds the allowed length when Subscriber Number and Invoice Number lengths exceeds the max length.
