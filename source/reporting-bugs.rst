Reporting bugs
==============
So it should come as no suprise that |projectName| is not without bugs.
This section contains a few points on what we would like you to do when submitting bug reports.

Let's start with the boring part first: if you are NOT an |projectName| customer, (i.e. you are a third party) then you have to submit your bug through your customer contact, and we can establish contact afterwards. 
If you are a customer please make sure you submit the bug through the usual support channels.

Information in Bug Reports
--------------------------
Please include the following in your bug report

* The Tenant Id/Name
* The Client Id used to generate the request
* A description of the actual behaviour and the expected behaviour
* The raw HTTP request and response that caused the bug

Feedback, Comments and Suggestions
----------------------------------
If you want to provide suggestions and general feedback regarding the API, please reach out to us using the GITHUB REPO.

If you want to request a new feature in the service, please this is not the channel for it!
