Self-Service and Salesposter Custom Domain
==========================================

By default all tenants utilizing the |projectName| self-service and salesposter solution will be hosted on a generic azure domain name in the form, `https://{tenantName}-s4.azurewebsites.net`.

While functional, it may be desirable to have a custom domain, which is possible but currently requires some manual work by Infosoft support.
If a custom domain is required please :ref:`contact support <reporting-bugs>`.

Consequences of enabling Custom Domains
---------------------------------------
Simply put there are no direct consequences of establishing a custom domain.

The old domain will keep on working without issues, and the new one will also be accessible.

All example URLs in the documentation that refers to the self-service site can be replaced with the custom domain name.
