What is INFO-Subscription
=========================

INFO-Subscription is a service that provides subscription billing and management, in simple terms it creates invoices, manages payments and maintains subscriptions based on these invoices and payments.

What is it not?
---------------
Depending on your point of view it might be easier to understand what it is by describing what it isn't 

CRM
^^^
INFO-Subscription contains a small customer management module, that will allow you to manage simple information about a customer. 
It is not a fully fledged CRM system, neither is it going to attempt to fulfil that role. We do however provide options for integrating with third party CRMs so you can bring your own.

Delivery, Distribution and Packaging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Many subscriptions requires some sort of physical distribution of products. 
While INFO-Subscription is somewhat capable of producing information to distribution and packaging systems, it is not capable of generating package slips, driver routes etc.

Magic
^^^^^
No, unfortunately it is not driven by magic just yet!
